### Contributing
If you would like to contribute (plz & thnx), see the TODO list below, or issues, for things that need to be done.
Just clone the repo and fix stuff. Then when you're done, open a pull request and I might merge it.

If you don't understand bits of my code we can chat about it over on [gitter](https://gitter.im/quick-read). 
Or just try really hard to understand it and then fix it so others can understand it.
